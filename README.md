Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and increased survival rates. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer based on characteristics of breast tissue, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding patient care.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features each, describing the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the breast tissue. The dataset also contains a binary target variable indicating whether the sample is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, execute the main.py script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train several machine learning models, evaluating their performance using various metrics. The best performing model will be saved for future use.

Results
The results of the project, including model performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the results folder. This folder is automatically generated after running the main.py script.
